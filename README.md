# Transfer Learning Using TensorFlow

The Transfer Learning technique is very effective on Deep Leraning models. It is a quick way to create a complex architecture like the ResNet and Inception models for example, they come with pre-trained parameters, the training of these large neural networks is available, all through the PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries.

I used this script for my X-ray image reader project and to be able to identify whether this image is of a person infected by the covid-19 virus, pneumonia or of a person without lung diseases.

Below are some images of my project on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website, I will also leave the access link so that you can read my complete project with all my contributions, opinions and results of the forecasts that were made with the images.

This first image is testing whether the libraries were imported correctly and whether the image is read correctly.

This second is the accuracy of my model, which at the time of this post is 75% correct, considering that there were four different types of classifications to be made of the images. In the file of the x-ray images there were patients with COVID-19, virulent pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and normal lung.

And the latter is the result of one of the predictions that were made with one of the images. **The prediction was correct!**
